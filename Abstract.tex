\chapter*{Asbtract}

In recent years, parallel computing has become more popular, with the advancement of hardware, such as multicore processor, and the development of parallel architecture. Nowadays, parallization exists in many places, such as modern day PC/Workstation, Cluster, Grid Computing system or High Performance Computing system in general. This is due the demand for enhancement in computing performance to solve enormous, complex problem. \\
The main focus of the intership is to investigate potential improvement for the Regional Climate Model with GPU and parallelization, and provide some proofs of concept for this matter. Testing will be conducted using OpenMP Parallel API.\\
